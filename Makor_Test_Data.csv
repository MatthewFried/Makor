This was reported to the Justice Center (aka: JC) and OPWDD. Mr. Salamon’s leg was swollen. X-rays at the hospital revealed a fracture. Further X-rays revealed healing fractures in his ribs.  The investigation was done by the JC and this allegation of Neglect by a DSP has been UNSUBSTANTIATED.  In response, The IRC committee accepted the recommendations that staff be retrained on their supervision levels and that the RN go through the medical information to ensure that there wasn’t any missing medical information.   This incident was closed and classified as an unsubstantiated case of Neglect.     "
